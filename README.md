## Features

Create an interactive map with a custom background. Place various features with editable descriptions and names across a scrollable map.

Supported feature layers:

- Markers
- Circle Markers
- Polylines
- Polygons
- Rectangles
- Circles

Maps can be created from the activity bar icon, which also lists recently opened maps.
Multi-root workspaces are supported, map files should be located inside a workspace to be recognized.

Images used for maps are stored inside the interactive-map folder of the corresponding workspace, moving that and the json, along with the map files is enough to use them in another workspace.

Feedback and feature requests are appreciated.
